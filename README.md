# ieee_parser


Prerequisites
=============
* python 2.7 installed
* git installed

Installation
============
* git clone https://github.com/avi3tal/ieee_parser.git
* cd ieee_parser
* python setup.py install

note: now we will have ieee.py application cli installed locally

Usage
=====
Single execution example
ieee.py -a <apikey> -b -o </path/to/output.json>

note: once the application is installed locally we can easily 
use it as cron job in our file system


The easiest way would be to collect all 500 articles per day and do the union
as part of the SQL implementation
