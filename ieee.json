Economic Dispatch and Load Frequency Control are unified in this approach. The companion papers published earlier in the Transactions by the PES dealt with Load Estimation in Part I [3] and Dispatch Targeting in Part II [4]. This current paper, Part III, deals with the problem of tracking the economic target curves established in Part II. In tracking the target curves, unit dynamics, including boiler dynamics, are taken into account. The problem is decomposed in such a way that the slower, bulk control is based on a fully nonlinear and dynamic model of the unit while faster load fluctuations are traced by fast, dynamic vernier control based on a linearized model. This results in fuel economy coupled with tight and smooth control which demands very moderate computational load.

This is the reason why search engines have been emerged, aiming to relieve the user from the \"lost in hyperspace\" feeling and the information overload. Imagine, however, cases where the result of some query to a search engine contains hundreds of thousands of URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). With such a number of URLs, search engines become in practice inefficient, if we consider that the navigation through even a few decades of URLs is very tiring and time consuming. Thus, instead of trying to address the information overload problem with search engines and robots (spiders), we believe that each server should facilitate itself the retrieval of desired information, published on its own domain. In this paper we present \"Archimides\", an intelligent agent that aims to provide intelligent, adaptive and personalized navigation within a WEB server. Provided a subset of the set of keywords that characterize the server's contents, Archimides undertakes the task to perform an intelligent information retrieval and afterwards to construct a personalized version of the server in the form of an index to pages that present some interest to the user. This index does not resemble what search engines return as a result of some query; it could be probably regarded as a much sorter version of the WEB server, with links that are dynamically inserted or deleted according to the user's interests, preferences and behavior, providing Archimides with the feature of adaptivity.

By \"automatic\", it is meant that the fusion algorithm per se does not require fiducial points; it does require a certain form of human interactions in terms of providing users a list of parameter settings at the beginning of the fusion, that are case-based, anatomy-based, and image-modality-based, and it does even allow users to have an option to change the specific values of the parameter settings to accommodate specific clinical needs. This \"automatic\" approach allows radiologists to save their time/effort in identifying and marking the fiducial points in the images, allows physicians and radiologists to apply their domain expertise more intelligently in \"playing with\" different parameter settings in a higher level when running this algorithm in diagnoses, and also allows patients to avoid the inconvenience to be placed under the fiducial markings.

We specifically narrow down on an important everyday bioinformatics application namely Blast, used commonly by biologists for everyday research. A detailed literature study was undertaken to observe the gaps specific to the applications performance subjected to different quality of service constraints and system specific parameters under the confluence of a dynamic mini grid test bed. A number of gaps were identified; throughput in terms of latency (message passing); scalability (load balancing) and application performance (reliability) needs to be addressed. An experimental mini grid test bed was implemented to simulate various conditions and to test the proposed hypotheses. The implemented architecture utilizes game theoretic optimization and agent based team formation (Coalition) algorithms to improve upon scalability with respect to team formation. Due to the dynamic nature of distributed systems (as discussed in previous works) all interactions are made local within a team transparently.

The first spring had a realistic behavior, since its visual and haptic displacements were identical. The second spring-the pseudo-haptic one-was stiffer on a haptic basis, but sometimes less stiff on a visual basis. The data collected allowed us to calculate the visual point of subjective equality (PSE) between the two springs, which represents the boundary of the sensory illusion. On average, a high value of PSE turned out to be -24%. This value increased monotonically when the haptic difference between the springs increased. This implies that more visual deformation is necessary to compensate for large haptic differences and qualifies the notion of visual dominance.

It is vital to take an overall company point of view: (1) sales, (2) production, (3) finance, and the combination of all three, (4) growth policy. 2. Operational research: It is vital that a company should have an operational research policy and team. Their own team can be aided valuably by outside specialists and consultants who can bring to bear a very wide range of experience from quite different industries. Objective facts then discovered must be assessed against their economic implications. They must be carefully weighed bearing all the above four points in mind. 3. Choice of correct approach: Having obtained sufficient facts, management must have sufficient courage to act quickly and adopt a short as well as a long term development and re-equipment policy. One must be conscious that facts of today are not necessarily true of a remote tomorrow and thus the choice of approach should always favour the method and plant having maximum flexibility. Also, the operational research team must continue to function and keep gathering facts, its policy being steered by the results of market research and overall concepts of the Board. 4. Serviceability and maintaining the plant: Having chosen as my case study automatic bakeries, these illustrate some most valuable lessons. For instance, one should choose equipment which is easy to service; interchangeable tropicalised control and motor units should be adopted, requiring minimum attention. Encapsulated plugin units which remove the need for scientific trouble-shooting should be preferred. Means of selfmaintenance, e.g. self-lubricating bearings, temperature-compensated equipment, self-cleaning by compressed air blasts, etc., are the kind of facilities that must be planned into automated plants.

Most of the coal liquids can be used directly as boiler fuels without further upgrading, while some heavier liquids would require mild hydroprocessing. Gas turbines require cleaner liquids, which can only be generated by severe hydroprocessing of distillate coal liquids. Most coal liquids with proper processing can meet the fuel specifications of turbine and boiler manufacturers and meet or exceed the environmental requirements.

This system was specifically designed and tested for antenna applications, even though the earlier tests were made in terms of scattering measurements. Based on the recent interest in radar cross-section, the compact range has been re-examined in terms of its capabilities for measuring the scattering properties of large structures. The Ohio State University has been one of the pioneers in developing the proper use. capabilities; and modifications necessary to make the compact range one of the most accurate electromagnetic pattern measurement systems available. As a result, new systems have been designed using various electromagnetic analyses to guide this research effort. These changes include the reflector, feeds, target mount, instrumentation, absorber, target handling techniques, data processing, calibration methods, calibration targets, etc. In most cases, the theoretical solutions have been verified by experimental results, and in some cases, the new designs have been incorporated in Commericial products.

With Internet becoming more heterogeneous with more and more wireless error-prone links, a TCP connection may unduly throttle its sending rate and experience poor performance over paths experiencing random losses unrelated to congestion. The problem of distinguishing congestion losses from random losses is particularly hard when congestion is light: congestion losses themselves appear to be random. The key idea is to \"de-randomize\" congestion losses. This paper proposes a simple biased queue management scheme that \"de-randomizes\" congestion losses and enables a TCP receiver to diagnose accurately the cause of a loss and inform the TCP sender to react appropriately. Bounds on the accuracy of distinguishing wireless losses and congestion losses are analytically established and validated through simulations. Congestion losses are identified with an accuracy higher than 95% while wireless losses are identified with an accuracy higher than 75%. A closed form is derived for the achievable improvement by TCP endowed with a discriminator with a given accuracy. Simulations confirm this closed form. TCP-Casablanca, a TCP-Newreno endowed with the proposed discriminator at the receiver, yields through simulations an improvement of more than 100% on paths with low levels of congestion and about 1% random wireless packet loss rates.

This paper discusses the main reason for the disappointment, namely, the effort to build high performance into an electric car that can travel a long distance before the batteries are depleted, an objective that is inherently impossible with today's battery technology. However, with an infrastructure of electric outlets for charging EV batteries where cars are normally parked, electric automobiles could be introduced rapidly into the population of automobiles with existing technology. The key to the practicality of EVs is to design for the fact that most usage of road vehicles, except buses, taxis and long-haul trucks, is for short trips. When the EV is not being used, the batteries could be charged (a process called biberonnage), if there were networks of electric outlets where vehicles are normally parked. This subject is discussed qualitatively and quantitatively. Examples are given of experimental charging when the EV is not in use, where ranges of 160 km or more per day were obtained. The paper also shows that in most applications of the use of any car, the intervals between the vehicle actually being driven is more than 1/2 hour. This represents an interval long enough to charge the lead batteries sufficiently to drive the EV over 130 km per day.

Three major energy consumption and conversion sectors: heat, electricity and mobility face transformation challenges, which are targeting the fulfilment of governmental CO2 reduction targets. The electricity sector, one of the forerunners and major \"Energiewende\" pillars, passes a phase of political and economic challenges concerning suitable market design on the one side and necessary investments measures on the other side. Besides the expansion of electricity generation capacity based on renewable energy sources, the economical operation of flexible, gas-fired load control and back-up power plants is an essential condition for a successful system transformation. On the road to the envisioned long-term \"Energiewende\" targets, we identify three phases which will be playing an important role in the provisioning of reliable, affordable and zero/low emission power generation of the future. Phase 1 must address the development and implementation of a new, suitable electricity market design, which will enable future investment in thermal generation and storage capacities. Due to lack of economics very limited construction of new gas fired central power plants is expected in this phase. The flexibility of the existing units is generally sufficient in responding to the system requirements. Phase 2 will deploy advanced, \"multimodal-ready\" generation and storage technologies and provide enhanced flexible solutions to integrate higher amounts of volatile wind and solar power. In this phase an adoption of a new market design, honouring values of energy and plant availability will be indispensable. Bivalent supply patterns will involve broadly. Finally, phase 3 predominantly based on \"sun\" fuels, can be described in terms of multimodal supply patterns with close interlink between the supply systems for electricity, gas, heat, cooling, water and fuels for mobility. These supply patterns will allow a comprehensive integ- ation of the largest amounts of renewable generation and will offer a strong improvement of overall system efficiency and economics.", "pdf_url": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7388501", "publication_title": "International ETG Congress 2015; Die Energiewende - Blueprints for the new energy age", "conference_dates": "17-18 Nov. 2015", "authors": ["Uwe Lenk", "Ireneusz Pyc", "Florian Steinke"]}, {"abstract": "<div style=\"font-variant: small-caps; font-size: .9em;\">First Page of the Article</div><img class=\"img-abs-container\" style=\"width: 95%; border: 1px solid #808080;\" src=\"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/04926815.png\" border=\"0\">", "pdf_url": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4926815", "publication_title": "Production Engineer", "index_terms": {}, "title": "\"Engineer yourself a brighter future\""}, {"index_terms": ["Biological system modeling", "Cells (biology)", "Contracts", "Dermis", "Diseases", "Extracellular", "Fibroblasts", "Humans", "In vitro", "Wounds"], "title": "\"Engineering\" the wound-healing process", "abstract": "Our group is studying the modulation of fibroblast behavior by various wound-healing agents. 3-D collagen gels were used as an in vitro wound model to study human dermal fibroblast behavior.

We present Automatic Integrated Routing (AIR) as the first routing protocol that eliminates flooding by assigning prefix labels to switches and building a Distributed Hash Table (DHT). The DHT maps host identifiers to the prefix labels of the switches through which they connect to the network. Each switch is assigned a prefix label using neighbor-to-neighbor messages. Prefix labels denote the locations of the switches in the network, and the prefix labels of any two switches automatically determine one or multiple routes between them. The DHT stores the mapping between the name of a host and its network location (prefix label) in a scalable fashion, with any one switch storing only a fraction of all the mappings. In contrast, prior approaches using DHTs to resolve host names incur the communication and storage overhead introduced by an underlying link-state routing protocol. Results using packet-level traces of Internet traffic demonstrate that AIR attains performance gains of orders of magnitude over Ethernet bridging and prior DHT-based schemes.", "pdf_url": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5541709", "publication_title": "2010 IEEE 30th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems", "conference_dates": "21-25 June 2010", "authors": ["Dhananjay Sampath", "Suchit Agarwal", "J.

While compilers have generally proven adept at planning useful static instruction-level parallelism, relying solely on the compiler's instruction execution arrangement performs poorly when cache misses occur, because variable latency is not well tolerated. This paper proposes a new micro architectural model, multipass pipelining, that exploits meticulous compile-time scheduling on simple in-order hardware while achieving excellent cache miss tolerance through persistent advance preexecution beyond otherwise stalled instructions. The pipeline systematically makes multiple passes through instructions that follow a stalled instruction. Each pass increases the speed and energy efficiency of the subsequent ones by preserving computed results. The concept of multiple passes and successive improvement of efficiency across passes in a single pipeline distinguishes multipass pipelining from other runahead schemes. Simulation results show that the multipass technique achieves 77% of the cycle reduction of aggressive out-of-order execution relative to in-order execution. In addition, micro architectural-level power simulation indicates that benefits of multipass are achieved at a fraction of the power overhead of full dynamic scheduling.", "pdf_url": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1540970", "publication_title": "38th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO'05)", "conference_dates": "12-16 Nov. 2005", "authors": ["R.

Gateways provide interoperability among disparate systems by providing a transparent connectivity solution that eliminates the need to replace or modify the systems themselves. The new generative gateway toolkit (GGTK) approach achieves this interoperability by leveraging common data-transport and data-exchange semantics, and abstracting hardware platform and device interface details from core gateway functionality. Software product line architecture methods are used to ensure large-scale reuse and provide the capability to specify at a high-level 'what to build'. Generative programming techniques extend this capability, using the high-level specifications to actually build functional component-based gateways. Central to the architecture is accommodation for variation and evolutionary extension of its communications and semantic processing services. The scope of this research is focused on addressing new and legacy system interoperability problems caused by stove piped architectures and a proliferation of interfaces. Primary focus is placed on the current use of gateways to solve DoD tactical data link (TDL) interoperability problems. Traditional gateway development approaches have led to a proliferation of custom point-to-point solutions built from the ground-up on a project-by-project basis. The new GGTK approach exploits the common and variable features of the communications gateway domain, combining reusable software assets that were systematically developed and assembled for generation into fully-functional customized gateways.

The goal of this project is to develop and build a hands-free navigation system to be integrated into virtual environments. One of the most important fields in virtual reality (VR) research, is the development of systems that allow the user to interface with the virtual environment. The most intuitive method for moving through a virtual landscape is by walking. The implementation of a walking interface for a virtual reality system also allows a greater range of biomechanical experimentation and game research. Systems ranging from different platforms have already been implemented to produce virtual walking; however, these systems have been designed primarily for use with head mounted display systems. We believe that hands-free navigation, unlike the majority of navigation techniques based on hand motions, has the greatest potential for maximizing the interactivity of virtual environments, due to more direct motion of the feet. To make this possible, we created a new and simple device using acceleration sensors to detect ankle movements within the virtual environment.

The 3D reconstruction of such environments can thus reduce to the localization of lines in the 3D space. Multi-view reconstruction requires the solution of the correspondence problem. The use of a single image to localize space lines is attractive, since the correspondence problem can be avoided. However, using a perspective camera (or a central one), a line can not be localized, since its viewing surface is planar, and hence it can contain infinite lines other than the correct one. In this paper we study the number of planar viewing surfaces for a general class of catadioptric cameras, constituted by an axial symmetric mirror and a perspective camera placed at generic relative position. We show that, under broad conditions, there is only a discrete set of planar viewing surfaces for the considered class of cameras. This result establishes a qualitative difference with respect to axial-symmetric cameras (e.g., catadioptric cameras constituted by an axial-symmetric mirror plus a perspective camera, whose viewpoint is constrained to be on the mirror axis), where an infinite set of planar viewing surfaces exists. Then, some conditions are derived for the localization of lines in the 3D space from single images.

If they were deployed as an \"intelligent suite\", with all components cross-compatible, EMS of the near future would be dramatically more effective than that of the recent past. The present analysis is a synopsis of a 1990 motor vehicle accident reconstructed from actual EMS run data. A hypothetical comparative call has been constructed, set in similar fashion but integrating currently-available ICT components. Deploying today's ICT arsenal as a coherent system results in dramatically decreased dispatch, en route, and response times, and blurs the distinction between the need for transport and the need for adequate medical treatment.

The direction of the stripes is that of the local in-plane magnetization vector. Thus the angle of deflection is perpendicular to the local in-plane magnetization, as is the case for Lorentz deflection. Micrographs are presented demonstrating that with a displaced aperture one can perform with light the analogues of the two modes of Lorentz microscopy: light-field microscopy in the defocused mode and dark-field microscopy with light normal to the film plane. In the defocused mode, walls appear as either bright streaks or dark streaks; if one focuses on the opposite side of the film the bright walls become dark and vice-versa. In the dark-field mode the contrast of the dark regions and the bright regions can be reversed by moving the aperture.", "pdf_url": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1058288", "publication_title": "IEEE Transactions on Magnetics", "authors": ["E.

The picture that emerges is that all pure diamond is in elemental terms - characterized by no fewer than 58 impurities, of which 53 of these elements have been determined by nuclear methods, and 34 of them have been determined only by nuclear methods. If quantitative analytical data is obtained, as it should be, then a number of deductions can be made about the chemistry of the elemental impurities - such a trace element chemistry (at the ppb to ppm level!) is found to exist, which brings into focus the question of the mode of physical occurrence of these characteristic chemical impurities.

Several of the projects ongoing in my laboratory are described below. Tissue Engineered Vascular Grafts: There is tremendous need for materials for small diameter vascular grafts. Synthetic materials have not proved suitable, and tissue transplantation is limited. Tissue engineering may provide an answer. My laboratory is approaching this problem from two directions; synthesis of novel scaffold materials that mimic extracellular matrix and genetic manipulation of the cells seeded into these scaffolds. The scaffold materials under development provide signals to promote cell adhesion, to control synthesis of matrix proteins, to regulate cell growth, and to allow degradation of the polymer as new tissue forms. The goals for genetic engineering of smooth muscle and endothelial cells are to reduce thrombosis and improve the mechanical properties of the engineered arteries. Medical Applications of Metal Nanoshells: Nanoshells are a new type of nanoparticle with tunable optical properties. For medical applications, these particles can be designed to strongly absorb or scatter light in the near infrared where tissue and blood are relatively transparent. In a cancer therapy application, nanoshells are designed to absorb light and convert the energy to heat for tumor destruction.", "pdf_url": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4461655", "publication_title": "2006 International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "conference_dates": "Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006", "authors": ["Jennifer L.

Usually, the unknown parameters of the model are estimated, in any given region of interest (ROI), by least squares (LS). However, when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of PET data is too low, LS does not allow reliable parameter estimation. To overcome this problem, we study in this paper the applicability of approaches originally developed in the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic literature and referred to as \"population approaches\". In particular, we consider the iterative two stage (ITS) method, which, given a set of M ROIs drawn on PET images of a given individual, estimates the unknown model parameters of each ROI by exploiting the information contained in all the M ROIs. After having revised the theory behind ITS, we assess its performance versus LS by using Monte Carlo simulations which allow us to evaluate the bias of the two methods in a variety of situations. Then, we compare the performance of LS and ITS in two case studies on [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG kinetics in human skeletal muscle. Both simulated and real case studies results show that a population approach is of potential in modeling PET images since it allows to reliably estimate model parameters also in those ROIs where either a bad SNR or a poor sampling (e.g., infrequent scanning and/or short experiment duration) make the use of LS unsuccessful.", "pdf_url": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269875", "publication_title": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "authors": ["A.

A modelization of reverberation is often used to improve detection because classical algorithms are inefficient. A commonly used reverberation model is colored and nonstationary noise. This model leads to elaborate detection algorithms which normalize and whiten reverberation. In this paper, we focus on a more deterministic model which considers reverberation as a sum of echoes issued from the transmitted signal. The Principal Component Inverse (PCI) algorithm is used with this model to estimate and delete the reverberation echoes. A rank analysis of the observation matrix shows that PCI is efficient in this configuration under some conditions, such as when the transmitted signal is Frequency Modulated. Both methods are validated with real sonar surface reverberation noise. We show that whitening has poor performance when reverberation and target echo have the same properties, while PCI maintains the same performance whatever the reverberation characteristics. Further, we extend the algorithms to spatio-temporal data. We propose a new algorithm for PCI which allows better echo separation.

Over the past quarter-century, most research on decision-making and other aspects of macrocognition has been conducted using some form of cognitive task analysis. In this essay, we focus on the cost of cognitive task analysis. Cognitive task analysis can be resource-intensive and requires skilled practitioners of the craft to make the investment of time and resources worthwhile. Providing valid, useful, actionable findings from cognitive task analysis requires thoughtful analysis and representation in ways that communicate meaning. Yet, many system development efforts have not relied enough on cognitive task analysis, and have instead fallen into the trap of designer-centered design. Not only does this preclude the development of a human-centered system, it obviously avoids the actual challenge. But does cognitive task analysis have to take as long as it seems to?

In these detectors, spherical CsI(Tl) scintillation crystals, having diameters ranging from 3.4 cm (20 cm<sup>3</sup>) to 8.3 cm (300 cm<sup>3'</sup>), were polished and packed in dry MgO powder. The scintillation light from the crystal was viewed using a single 1 &times; 1 cm<sup>2</sup> silicon PIN diode. A low-noise preamplifier was also integrated within the detector housing. The measured noise level was equivalent to &sim;800 electrons (FWHM). Such a configuration results in a relatively high light-collection efficiency. For example, in the 300 cm<sup>3</sup> (8.3 cm diameter) detector, an average of &sim;10 electron/hole pairs were generated for each keV deposited in the crystal. One of the key features of this detector design is that it minimizes the spatial variations in the light-collection efficiency throughout the detector. Compared with a standard 3-in NaI(Tl) scintillation counter, this leads to a much-improved energy resolution, particularly for photon energies above 1 MeV The results presented in this paper clearly demonstrate that these spherical CsI-photodiode detectors could be used as an ideal replacement for the standard 3-in NaI(Tl) detectors in many applications.", "pdf_url": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1043434", "publication_title": "IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science", "authors": ["L.

To avoid or at least to reduce these effects a \"selective\" region growing algorithm was developed, which combines the evaluation of class specific spectral information and immediate vicinity relations of pixels. In a first pass the data are classified by using exclusively spectral information. Based on the assumption that neighbouring pixels are more likely to belong to same class, a second classification cycle is applied with a stringent \"vicinity\" condition combined with a wider definition of the spectral characteristics. Different from conventional region growing methods, these wider spectral characteristics can be defined separately for each class and are independent from spectral similarity to the original class. By re-iteration of the algorithm on the data, neighbouring pixels, belonging to the respective class, grow selectively, closing successive classification gaps. The algorithm reduces unclassified pixels remarkably, increasing the overall classification accuracy and can be easily adopted in other tasks.", "index_terms": ["Image analysis", "Information analysis", "Land use planning", "Pixel", "Remote sensing", "Satellites", "Scattering", "Spatial resolution", "Statistics", "Testing"], "publication_title": "IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium", "conference_dates": "2002", "authors": ["C.

Because of the lack of voltage sensors, the grid voltage has to be estimated. Two voltage estimation methods are used: voltage estimation by instantaneous active and reactive power estimation and a novel voltage estimation by phase tracking. These methods are compared with each other and the experimental results are presented. The control concept was realized on a prototyping system for power electronics control. The influence of the system parameter variations (e.g. line inductance) on the control behavior is investigated. Using the proposed sensorless method it is possible to reduce the sampling frequency of the AC-line currents, because there is no need for synchronization with the PWM-pulse pattern and there is no need for additional test signals.

In this paper, we expose the performance gap between the computing core and the entire system, distinguishing them by quantitative approach with metrics-peak performance and mean-time performance. To balance the gap, a \"software pipelined\" formula for lifting-based DWT kernel, a novel enhanced DMA engine named iDMA, and a complete design of 2-D DWT using hierarchical pipelining method are proposed. Finally, the architecture has been implemented in Xilinx virtex-II xc2v500-5.

Although monoclonal antibodies have been pursued as new commercial candidates for about 30 years, advances in antibody engineering were required to de-immunize them for repeated human use, and when used as targeting agents, various constructs with isotopes, drug, and toxins have been developed and commercialized. As new targets become identified, the diverse antibody products are gaining in attention as prospective new therapeutics even beyond cancer, such as in the therapy of autoimmune, infectious, and neurodegenerative diseases. Not only are new antibody constructs of multifunctional nature being developed for enhanced potency, but new delivery systems involving methods of separating the targeting moiety from the effector molecules (radionuclided, drugs, toxins, cytokines), such as in so-called pretargeting methods, are under development. These advances have resulted in the concept of targeted disease therapy, attended by a better safety profile for this new class of pharmaceuticals, and are being used increasingly in combination with conventional cytotoxic drugs approved for the therapy of cancer and immune diseases. These disease-targeting antibodies, however, should soon decrease the dependence on traditional cytotoxic drugs by targeting such agents more selectively as immunoconjugates, especially with pretargeting technologies.", "pdf_url": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4461657", "publication_title": "2006 International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "conference_dates": "Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006", "authors": ["David M.

It also examines the bandwidth and service requirements for this \"video revolution\", and the role optical networks can play.

Moreover, delivery will be over a multiplicity of competing media: broadcast, cable, discs, copper, and fibre.

We have found that, to fully understand innovative business clusters, stacks and chains of TAOs are a more useful presentation than capturing the whole organizational cluster of a corporation or chain in just one business representation. Studying the dynamics of individual TAOs within these networks, it became clear that also dynamic knowledge streams play an important role between individual organizations. These knowledge loops have their own cycle time. Differences in cycle time may limit exchange of information so that therefore not all TAO functions can be performed by just any company, limiting innovation. Especially universities, government funded laboratories and government funded-research programs, with their long cycle times play an important role in potential mismatching these differences in dynamics. From the insights from the stacks and chains of TAOs and their dynamics behavior guidelines may be derived for setting up more effective innovation programs for universities, commercial and public research institutes and public funded research programs.

This paper provides preliminary answers to these questions in line with human cognitive models, and demonstrates that \"understanding understanding\" across engineering disciplines allows elements of sustainability to be introduced in engineering education (examples are given from electrical and computer engineering.)

The system draws upon a fundamental difference between reputation and image as a way out from the trade-off between agents' autonomy and their need to adapt to social environment. A full exploitation of its potentialities includes the activation of a special module, the analyzer, aimed at solving possible inconsistencies, uncertainties and incompleteness in the output of lower level modules by means of inner simulation. In this work, Repage's analyzer architecture is described; some representative examples of problems posed by the planner to the analyzer is discussed and hypothetical simulations are run within this module to find a solution to uncertainty, avoiding at the same time the exceeding complexities of rule-based reasoning and the costs of reinforcement learning.", "index_terms": ["Analytical models", "Autonomous agents", "Computational modeling", "Costs", "Decision making", "Game theory", "Humans", "Learning", "Uncertainty", "Weapons"], "publication_title": "IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology", "conference_dates": "19-22 Sept. 2005", "authors": ["M.

In a scenario, where a single operator owns different types of networks, QoS provision can be achieved by introducing complex multi-system resource management. On the contrary, if local area networks are deployed by different entities, due to the lack of both coordination and centralized RRM management, the experienced QoS may drastically fluctuate, ranging from SLAs in wide area, to only \"best effort\" expectations in local area networks. In order for \"nomadic\" terminal agents to perform \"informed\" access selection decisions, we propose the adoption of \"word-of-mouth\" (WoM), a novel scheme for sharing, in a peer-to-peer fashion, information about the service quality experienced with different networks. The performances of our proposed WoM scheme have been evaluated for a file pre-fetching service, considering information characterized by various degrees of time criticality, when different RRM strategies are implemented in the local area networks. The results show that if a critical mass of terminal agents exchange experienced QoS information, the overall network selection decision is improved: terminal agents can estimate, on beforehand, which type of performances to expect with different candidate networks, and avoid to select those not satisfying service requirements. This, in turn brings two main positive effects: on one hand, user perceived performance is improved, and, on the other hand, the adoption of RRM strategies providing some degree QoS is incentivated", "pdf_url": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1682927", "publication_title": "2006 IEEE 63rd Vehicular Technology Conference", "conference_dates": "7-10 May 2006", "authors": ["P.

Additionally, the service listing protocol can be completed using only wireless communications. Mobile users can quickly discover local available resources and services. Service providers can advertise their services to all people who are in the area and interested in those services. Our service listing protocol does not require high power or Web connectivity for the mobile users, making it quite appropriate for use by low-power devices such as PDA, laptop computers, and other handheld devices.

We find that the these changes are driven by newcomers, who adopt the most extreme linguistic practices as they enter the community. Moreover, this behavior correlates with engagement with the community: the newcomers that adopt deeper variant orthography tend to remain active for longer in the community, and posts with deeper variation receive more positive feedback in the form of &#x201C;likes.&#x201D; Previous work has linked community membership change with language change, and our work casts this connection in a new light, with newcomers driving an evolving practice rather than adapting to it.

It is composed of several modules, among them, two core modules : the relation engine and the collaborative interaction engine. On the one hand, the relation engine manages the relations between the objects of the environment. On the other hand, the collaborative interaction engine manages how users can collaboratively control objects. The modules that compose the #FIVE framework can be used either independently or simultaneously, depending on the requirements of the application. They can also communicate and work with other modules thanks to an API. For instance, a scenario engine can be plugged to any or both of the #FIVE modules if the application is scenario-based. #FIVE is a work in progress, new core modules will later be proposed.

The kinematics and dynamics of the trajectory tracking problem are always in strict feedback form. While there is no uncertainty in the kinematics, rapidly changing uncertainties present in the dynamics makes this problem an ideal candidate for L<sub>1</sub> adaptive backstepping control. The trajectory tracking controller serves as the outer-loop in a cascaded design architecture and supplies a reference quaternion and thrust to the inner-loop controller. The inner-loop controller in turn generates a moment demand for the control allocation module. Such an inner-outer loop architecture is modular and does away with the requirement that the commanded trajectory be four times differentiable as would be required if a single monolithic backstepping control law where to be used.

The proposed A<sup>2</sup>RC algorithm deals with the problem of how to accurately control the array response at a given direction. Starting from the adaptive array theory, a deep analysis of the optimal weight vector is carried out. It is found that the normalized response at a given direction can be accurately adjusted to an arbitrary level, by means of making some simple modification to the initial weight vector. On this basis, all possible weight vectors, which have a specific form and can make the normalized response at the given direction equal to the prescribed value, are first figured out. Then, an effective approach to selecting the most appropriate one, which would cause the least pattern distortion, is devised. By applying the A<sup>2</sup>RC algorithm, a new pattern synthesis approach for arbitrary arrays is developed. In this approach, the array pattern is adjusted in a point-by-point manner by successively modifying the weight vector. Contrary to the conventional approaches that assign artificial interferences in an ad hoc way, our approach is able to obtain the weight vector without iteratively determining the powers of the artificial interferences.

Then, the parameters in the second-order RC model are identified as polynomial functions with respect to SOC. Meanwhile, the battery model with constant parameters is also introduced for comparison. Due to that the battery model is undetectable, an one-sided Lipschitz condition is proposed to ensure that the nonlinear function in output equation can play a positive role in the observer design. After that, a nonlinear observer design criterion is presented based on the H<sub>&#x221E;</sub> method, which is formulated as linear matrix inequalities. Compared with existing nonlinear observer-based SOC estimation methods, the proposed observer design criterion does not depend on any estimates of the unknown variables.

However, the development of a reliable routing protocol to route data packets between vehicles and infrastructure gateways is still a challenging task due to the high mobility and frequent changes of the network topology. The conventional position-based routing (PBR) in VANETs can neither guarantee the existence of a routing path between the source and the destination prior to the transmission nor provide connection duration information, which makes it unsuitable to route Internet packets. In this paper, we propose a novel infrastructure-based connectivity aware routing protocol called i CAR-II that enables multihop vehicular applications, as well as mobile data offloading and Internet-based services. iCAR-II consists of a number of algorithms triggered and run by vehicles to predict local network connectivity and update location servers with real-time network information, in order to construct a global network topology. By providing real-time connectivity awareness, iCAR-II improves the routing performance in VANETs by dynamically selecting routing paths with guaranteed connectivity and reduced delivery delay. Detailed analysis and simulation-based evaluations of iCAR-II demonstrate the validity of using VANETs for mobile data offloading and the significant improvement of VANETs performance in terms of packet delivery ratio and end to end delay.", "pdf_url": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7544634", "publication_title": "IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology", "authors": ["Nizar Alsharif", "Xuemin Shen"]}]
